ðŸš€ CQRS API in Domain-Centric Design Architecture

This project showcases a CQRS API built with a domain-centric design architecture using .NET 8 and the Mediator pattern with a request pipeline.

âœ¨ Features

âœ… CQRS Implementation â€“ Clearly separates read and write operations for better maintainability and scalability.
âœ… Domain-Centric Design â€“ Emphasizes the business domain and core logic, ensuring a clean and modular architecture.
âœ… Mediator with Request Pipeline â€“ Implements the Mediator pattern to manage requests and responses efficiently, allowing a structured request-handling pipeline.

- Why Use a Request Pipeline with Mediator?
 Simplified Request Handling
A structured request pipeline provides a unified entry point, streamlining how requests are processed.

- Centralized Middleware Dependencies
Mediator acts as a middleware, handling cross-cutting concerns such as:
ðŸ”¹ Logging â€“ Maintain a detailed request log effortlessly.

ðŸ”¹ Validation â€“ Ensure data integrity before execution.

ðŸ”¹ Authorization â€“ Control access with a centralized approach.

By centralizing these concerns, we reduce code duplication and enhance maintainability.
